# Workout GUI Application

## Overview
This is a GUI application developed in Python for managing workouts. It provides functionality for entering new workouts, retrieving past workouts, and viewing workout statistics.

## Features
- **Enter Workouts:** Allows users to input details of their workouts, such as exercise type, sets, reps, weight, etc.
- **View Past Workouts:** Provides a page to browse through past workouts, enabling users to recall their training history.
- **Statistics Page:** Displays statistics such as total volume, total sets, total reps, and other relevant metrics, giving users insights into their training progress. I am currently working on a feature that uses an LLM to type custom recommendation pages based on current trends in the exercise science space. This is a heavily debated field, and often the answers to specifics about exercise are conflicted from study to study; thus, it is necessary you take all advice at your own disgression and risk.
